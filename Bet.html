<h1>Bet</h1>
<li> The term “bet” can be used in a few different ways, but generally means "agreed" or "okay". For example, if someone says "Wanna grab lunch later?" and the other person responds "Bet", it means they agree to the plan. “Bet" can also be used as a response to confirm that a statement is true.
